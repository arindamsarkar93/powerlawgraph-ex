# powerlawgraph-ex
This repo serves multiple purposes:
..* Extending the paper "Bayesian inference on random simple graphs with power-law degree distributions" - Juho Lee et al.

..* Experiment with other lines of work around power law behavior in Network graphs

#Trials on Stan implementation underway

#SBM
Added STAN implementation of SBM, and cluster indicator inference -- results not great!
